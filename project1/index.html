     <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
  Valorant is a first-person shooter videogame where the objective is to either plant or diffuse a bomb while the opposing team tries to stop you. I started playing when it first came out of beta, but I didn't play much until last semeseter where I played it off and on. Now, it's the only videogame I really play and try to climb the ranks with my friends because we're all terrible at the game.
