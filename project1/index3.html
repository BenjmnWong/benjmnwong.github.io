  <ul><b>Here are my feelings towards the game:</b>
    <li>I think this game is fun in small doses because it's so rage inducing even for someone who typically doesn't get mad at videogames.</li>
    <li>It's really team dependant and if you are matched with stupid people or people who are trying to lost it's really frustrating. This is why I try to play with 3-5 people I know so I can actually enjoy myself.</li>
    <li>The only reason I actually play is because a few of my friends do and it's really fun to play with them and only them. If I didn't have any friends who played the game it would be a complete waste of time but I do geniunely enjoy getting better and winning with my friends.</li>
